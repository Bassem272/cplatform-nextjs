<!-- In addition to the header and footer components, the components you need to create for your Next.js application depend on the specific features and UI elements required for your project. However, here are some common components that you may consider creating: -->

<!-- 1. **Navigation Component**: Apart from the header, you might need a separate navigation component for more complex navigation menus or sidebars. -->

<!-- 2. **Layout Component**: A layout component can encapsulate the overall layout structure of your pages, including the header, footer, and main content area. This can help maintain consistency across your application. -->

<!-- 3. **Button Component**: Create a reusable button component with different styles and variations (e.g., primary button, secondary button, etc.). -->

<!-- 4. **Form Components**: Components for building forms, such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, etc. -->

<!-- 5. **Modal Component**: If your application requires modal dialogs for displaying messages, alerts, or interactive content, consider creating a reusable modal component. -->

<!-- 6. **Card Component**: For displaying content in a card-like layout, create a reusable card component that can be easily styled and customized. -->

<!-- 7. **List Component**: A component for rendering lists of items, such as articles, products, or user profiles. -->

<!-- 8. **Avatar Component**: For displaying user avatars or profile pictures, create a reusable avatar component. -->

<!-- 9. **Alert Component**: Component for displaying various types of alerts or notifications to the user. -->

<!-- 10. **Spinner Component**: A spinner or loader component for indicating loading states or asynchronous operations. -->
<!-- 
11. **Icon Component**: Component for rendering icons or SVG graphics, which can be easily customized and reused throughout your application. -->

<!-- 12. **Image Component**: A wrapper component for handling images, with support for lazy loading, placeholders, and other optimizations. -->

<!-- 13. **Error Component**: Component for displaying error messages or handling error states gracefully. -->

<!-- 14. **Pagination Component**: If your application displays paginated content, create a pagination component for navigating between pages. -->

<!-- 15. **Tabs Component**: For organizing content into tabs or tabbed layouts, create a reusable tabs component. -->

<!-- These are just some examples of common components that you might need in your Next.js application. Depending on your project requirements, you may need to create additional components or customize existing ones to suit your specific needs. -->
